        <p>Male birds of paradise are known for their elaborate mating
rituals, and scientists have now discovered another interesting feature: biofluorescence. A recent study found that 37 of 45 species possess the ability to absorb
ultraviolet light and re-emit it as a bright green or yellow glow.
These birds, native to Australia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, use photoluminescent
feathers to attract mates. These feathers function by absorbing UV radiation from their
surroundings and emitting them at wavelengths that produce light rays that lie in the
visible spectrum for birds. Their fluorescent markings are often seen near ultra-black
feathers, which absorb nearly all light, creating a stark contrast that makes their glow
even brighter. This bio-fluorescent feather display likely enables them to signal genetic
fitness and mating readiness to potential mates, alongside increasing the likelihood that
they find a potential mate</p>
        <p>Not all birds of paradise exhibit this trait. Three genera—Lycocorax, Manucodia, and
Phonygammus—showed no signs of biofluorescence, possibly because they are
observed as being more monogamous and don’t rely on extravagant displays as a part of
their mating rituals. Scientists also found biofluorescence in the blue-capped ifrit, a
close relative of birds-of-paradise, suggesting that they all descended from a common
ancestor with this ability.
While male birds primarily use their bioluminescence for courtship, it may also have
additional functions. In other species, it helps with camouflage. Some birds also utilize
this phenomenon to exert dominance. Female birds of paradise also have biofluorescent plumage, though at lower levels, reinforcing the idea that males use their
glow primarily for attracting mates.</p>
        <p>Scientists are eager to study these birds in their natural environments, where their
fluorescence maybe even more intense. Up until now, optical displays in bird species
have remained severely understudied. However, the more studies around this topic
come to fruition, the more ornithologists can learn about the genetic similarity and
differentiation of bird species across the globe.</p>
