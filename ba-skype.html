        <p>Yes, Microsoft is shutting
down Skype, one of the earliest internetbased telecommunication and videocalling apps to exist. The app, which was
once the dominant platform for staying
connected online during the 2000s, will
no longer be accessible in May, and all
Skype chats will be moved to Microsoft Teams, with the two apps being merged
once and for all. Twenty-two years after
its launch, and fourteen years after
Microsoft purchased it for 8.5 billion
dollars (the largest Microsoft acquisition
at the time), Skype has now finally
reached the end of its life.“Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern
communications and supporting
countless meaningful moments, and we
are honoured to have been part of the
journey,” said Jeff Teper, president of
Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and
platforms, quoted online in a social media
post.</p>
        <p>The announcement, although initially
surprising, does not come as a major
shock given sufficient thought. Skype,
despite being one of the pioneers of
telecommunication apps, has been losing
its popularity throughout the past decade.
Despite a surge in users during the
pandemic, other competitors, such as
Zoom and Google Meet, have grown much
more substantially and repeatedly
overshadowed Skype in both
functionalities and user base.
Furthermore, Microsoft did not rely on
Skype as its only telecommunication app.
It has been developing Microsoft Teams,
which obtained more success in the past
years for both office organizations and
online classes during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>In other words, there is simply no more
incentive for a lot of contemporary users
to use Skype when other alternatives are
available that are often more accessible or
contain functionalities, such as Zoom calls
and Google Meetings that can be started
anytime with anyone using a simple link,
as well as no more motives from
Microsoft to devote separate resources
into Skype when MS Teams exist with the
same and more functionalities.
The removal of Skype is reflective of the
world’s rapid technological innovation.
We live in a world where apps cannot
survive for more than twenty years. That
is simply the reality.</p>
