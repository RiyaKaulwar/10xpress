        <p>The
potential return of V10 engines in
Formula 1 is generating huge excitement
and debate. F1 has relied on V6 hybrid
engines since 2014, and the new
regulations for 2026 will retain hybrids
and introduce eco-friendly fuels. The FIA
President, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, has
expressed interest in bringing back V10s
due to their loud and thrilling sound—
possibly by 2028 or beyond—thus aiming
to combine tradition with greener racing.</p>
        <p>The push for V10s is driven by multiple
factors. Technically, these engines are
simpler and lighter than current power
units; however, Nikolas Tombazis, the
FIA’s single-seater director, describes
them as way too expensive. On the other
hand, with V10 engines paired with
sustainable fuels, they could help F1
achieve its green goals while saving
money for the teams, given their nature as
easier and less expensive to produce and
repair. Emotionally, the iconic sound of
V10 engines could reignite fan passion.
Lewis Hamilton, during the Belgian Grand
Prix, said, “If we can move back to those
amazing-sounding engines and still meet
sustainable goals, why not?”. Fans’
dissatisfaction is evident in the boos heard
at the start of the 2025 season, suggesting
they miss the iconic sound.
</p>
        <p>However, challenges threaten the return
of V10s. The new 2026 rules are already in
place, and manufacturers like Audi,
Honda, and Ford have heavily invested in
the current hybrid engines. Red Bull’s
Christian Horner said that switching now
is far too late, calling it “ten past
midnight.” McLaren’s Zak Brown finds the
idea confusing, a real “headscratcher.”Mercedes’ Toto Wolff prefers
to keep things as they are, and Fernando
Alonso implied that V10s might consume
more fuel, meaning bigger tanks or refuelling
stops would be needed. For these reasons,
a switch to V10 engines before 2030
seems unlikely, though 2028 might be a
feasible middle ground for their return.
Reactions to this situation are mixed. Fans
and drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Max
Verstappen support the return of the
sound in F1, but engine manufacturers
remain hesitant about the reintroduction
of V10s. The FIA continues to weigh up
the contradiction between tradition and
innovation. While V10 engines promise
cost savings and a greener future, their
comeback depends on resolving these
complexities.
