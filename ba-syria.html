        <p>The Syrian conflict has been raging for 14 years now, yet it
remains one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of our time. Despite reduced
international attention, violence continues to plague various regions of the country,
resulting in the loss of civilian lives, displacement, and economic collapse. The situation
is exacerbated by ongoing clashes between government forces, rebel groups, and
foreign actors, each vying for control and influence in the war-torn nation.</p>
        <p>In 2024, renewed violence erupted in northwestern Syria, particularly in the Idlib
region, which remains under opposition control. According to the United Nations Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), airstrikes by Syrian and Russian
forces in early 2024 killed dozens of civilians and damaged critical infrastructure,
including hospitals and schools (OCHA, 2024). These attacks violate international
humanitarian law, which prohibits targeting civilian facilities, and have prompted
widespread condemnation from human rights organizations.

The economic consequences of the conflict are equally dire. Over 90% of Syrians now
live below the poverty line, and inflation has rendered basic necessities unaffordable for
many families (World Bank, 2024). This economic hardship is driving increased
displacement, both internally and externally. The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that over 13 million Syrians remain displaced, either
within Syria or in neighboring countries (UNHCR, 2024).
</p>
        <p>The humanitarian response is further hampered by the politicization of aid and
restricted access to certain areas. Cross-border aid deliveries from Turkey into
northwest Syria have faced logistical and political challenges, especially following the
devastating 2023 earthquake and the expiration of UN mandates (OCHA, 2024). As a
result, millions remain in desperate need of food, medical supplies, and shelter.
While international diplomatic efforts, such as those led by the UN and regional actors,
continue, progress toward a political resolution has stalled. Until a sustainable peace
agreement is reached, Syrians will continue to bear the brunt of a war that has already
claimed over 500,000 lives (Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 2024).</p>
