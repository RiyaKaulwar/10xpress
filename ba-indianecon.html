        <p>As India heads
into a blistering summer, the country is
facing not only an environmental issue
but also an economic one.

From the mango orchards of Devgad to
the textile town of Ludhiana, the effects of
longer summers are severely impacting
industries. Nitin Goel, whose family has
run a winter wear business for over five
decades, says his sweater sales have
dropped by more than 50% in the past five
years.</p>
        <p>India’s rising temperatures have led the
India Meteorological Department (IMD) to
report that February of this year was the
hottest in 125 years, with conditions
expected to worsen between March and
May. This has already negatively affected
Alphonso mangoes, with yields reduced to
a mere 30%, leaving several farmers
unemployed and threatening their
livelihoods.
Moreover, experts have warned that
wheat, chickpea, and other crop yields
could significantly decline this year, to the
same extent—or worse—than the crop
losses experienced during the 2022
heatwave. With reservoir levels in North
India falling to 28% of capacity,
forecasters predict further distress in the
agricultural sector, potentially raising
food prices and ultimately affecting
consumers.

However, the impact of rising
temperatures is particularly severe on one
sector: power.
</p>
        <p>The National Load Despatch Centre has
warned of electricity shortages amounting
to 15–20 gigawatts during the evenings of the peak summer months. Although India
has significantly expanded its renewable
energy sector, storage infrastructure
remains a challenge. Without advanced
batteries or storage systems to retain
excess solar power for later use, these
supply gaps may be unavoidable this year,
reducing quality of life and hindering
many people’s ability to work.
Compounding the challenge, global
pressure to phase out fossil fuels has
slowed the growth of thermal capacity,
making India’s dependence on coal-based
power increasingly vulnerable. The
Central Electricity Authority has issued a
warning, stating that “without urgent
action, this could spiral into a full-blown
crisis.”
With projected demand peaking at 270
GW this year, it is imperative to address
the issue. To that end, experts have begun
recommending energy-efficient
appliances and consumer incentives to
reduce electricity use during peak hours,
in an effort to minimise power cuts over
the summer.
Ultimately, this requires long-term action
—without which the country risks
entering a future of soaring temperatures,
low crop yields, overburdened power
grids, and economic loss.
